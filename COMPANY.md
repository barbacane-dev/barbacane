# Company Setup

This document outlines the legal and business structure for Barbacane.

## Goals

1. **Secure the Barbacane name** — Trademark protection across Europe
2. **European identity** — Legally EU-based, marketed as European-made
3. **Minimal bureaucracy** — Focus on building, not paperwork
4. **Future-proof** — Structure that scales to SaaS if needed

## Recommended Structure

### Company: Estonia OÜ (e-Residency)

**Why Estonia:**
- Fully digital incorporation and management
- No physical presence required
- 0% corporate tax on retained earnings (only taxed on distribution)
- EU-legal entity, eligible for EU contracts and grants
- Reputable jurisdiction, member of Eurozone

**Setup process:**
1. Apply for e-Residency card (~€100, 2-4 weeks)
2. Choose a service provider (LeapIN, Xolo, 1Office, Enty)
3. Incorporate OÜ through the provider (~€300-500)
4. Open business bank account (Wise Business, Revolut Business, or LHV)

**Ongoing costs:**
- Service provider: ~€50-100/month (accounting, compliance, registered address)
- Annual report filing: included with most providers
- No activity = minimal costs

**Timeline:** ~4-6 weeks from e-Residency application to operational company

### Trademark: EUTM via EUIPO

**What to register:**
- Word mark: "Barbacane"
- Classes: 9 (software), 42 (SaaS, consulting), possibly 41 (training)

**Process:**
1. Search existing marks at [EUIPO](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/)
2. File application online (~€850 for first class + €50 per additional class)
3. Examination period (~1 month)
4. Publication + opposition period (3 months)
5. Registration (valid 10 years, renewable)

**Timeline:** ~4-6 months to registration if no opposition

**Note:** Can file as individual before company exists, then transfer to company later.

### Banking

**Recommended:**
- **Wise Business** — Low fees, multi-currency, easy to open with Estonian OÜ
- **Revolut Business** — Good for EUR, card included
- **LHV** (Estonian bank) — Traditional bank, slower but more established

Open at least two accounts for redundancy.

### Hosting Infrastructure

EU-only providers to avoid US CLOUD Act / PATRIOT Act jurisdiction:

| Provider | Region | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Hetzner** | Germany/Finland | Best price/performance, very EU-focused |
| **OVH** | France | Large EU provider, good for French market positioning |
| **Scaleway** | France/Netherlands | Developer-friendly, EU-only |
| **Infomaniak** | Switzerland | Swiss privacy, GDPR-compliant |
| **Fuga Cloud** | Netherlands | Dutch provider, smaller but fully EU |

**Recommendation:** Hetzner for compute (price/performance), OVH or Scaleway as secondary. No US-headquartered providers.

## Action Items

- [EUIPO trademark search](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/)
- [EUIPO filing](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/apply-now)
- [Xolo](https://www.xolo.io/) — Popular e-Residency service provider
- [LeapIN](https://www.leapin.eu/) — Alternative service provider

## Notes

This structure keeps things simple while maintaining full EU legitimacy. The Estonian OÜ is recognized across the EU and internationally. If the business grows significantly, it's straightforward to add a subsidiary in France or another country later.

The key advantage: **you can start consulting and receiving payments within weeks**, not months of French bureaucracy.
